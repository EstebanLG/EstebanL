SVTludik is a website designed to help high schoolers in their learning process. It is specialized in biology.

<br>
<br>
This is the first professional related project I have ever worked on.
Therefore, I learnt a considerable amount of new skills while sharpening those I already had.
<br>
We were a 5 members team and the customer was a Parisian biology teacher willing to update the website she used as a 
complement to traditional courses.
<br>
I was in charge of verifying our production met the customer's main expectations and that all of her
new requests were taken into account by the rest of the team as I was the only member in direct relation with her. 
The client’s primary concern was to make it fun and very user-friendly. Thus, the website features games, social characteristics, 
an avatar creation tool and a simplified editing interface.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Regarding the actual development, the website was entirely created through agile software development tools. 
It was a first time for the whole team so adapting was quite tricky in the first place but our diligence enabled us to 
be productive only a short time after the project started.
<br>
With this project, my main goal was to learn how to do things I had never done before. 
For instance, Managing a team was something I have always wanted to do and it turned out very well in the end. 
During the development of the project, my first responsibility was to keep the team's efforts on track with the customer needs$
in order to avoid time waste and most of all deliver a good product.
<br>
I gained a lot of skills by managing the team and participating in the making of the website. 
Given that we had to work as a team while being scattered, the development required a lot of autonomy, communication, coordination 
and conscientiousness from us five. Communication really was a weakness beforehand but I feel like being involved with a lot of 
responsibilities on this project greatly improved my communication skills.
